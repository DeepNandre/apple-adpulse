## 2. Project Overview

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into digital advertising campaign performance and associated web analytics metrics. By simulating real-world data and creating a robust ETL pipeline, the project aims to replicate the process of transforming raw ad delivery and web behavior data into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard will adopt a clean, intuitive, "Apple-style" aesthetic to enhance usability and data consumption.

**Goals:**
1.  Establish a reproducible process for simulating or anonymizing digital advertising data.
2.  Develop a reliable and automated ETL pipeline using Python and SQL to ingest, clean, transform, and load data into a data warehouse.
3.  Design and implement a visually appealing, interactive dashboard in Tableau that adheres to an Apple-style aesthetic.
4.  Enable detailed analysis of campaign performance, A/B test outcomes, customer lifecycle stages (cohorts, funnel), and geographic performance within the EMEA region.
5.  Integrate web analytics metrics (like bounce rate, session duration) to provide a holistic view of campaign impact beyond direct ad conversions.
6.  Deliver actionable insights through effective data visualization and structure.
7.  Provide a public GitHub repository containing all source code and documentation for reproducibility.
8.  Deploy the final dashboard and runnable ETL scripts for public access (e.g., Tableau Public, hosted scripts).

**Target Users:**
*   Marketing Analysts
*   Campaign Managers
*   Business Stakeholders evaluating marketing ROI and customer engagement
*   Data Analysts/Engineers interested in the technical implementation

## 5. Dependencies and Constraints

**Dependencies:**
*   Access to Python environment (3.x recommended) with necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, SQL connector).
*   Access to a PostgreSQL database instance or ability to set up a local mock/container.
*   Access to Tableau Desktop for dashboard development (required for Tableau Public publishing).
*   A GitHub account for repository hosting.
*   Tableau Public account for dashboard deployment.
*   Source data file (simulated CSV).

**Constraints:**
*   Data must be simulated or anonymized; no real or sensitive data will be used.
*   Geographic analysis is limited to the EMEA region as defined in the simulated data.
*   The "Apple-style" aesthetic is a subjective guideline to be interpreted visually in Tableau.
*   ETL hosting might be limited to instructions for local execution based on available resources.
*   Tableau Public limitations apply (data is public, limited data source types).

## 6. Risk Assessment

**Risk 1: Difficulty simulating realistic data.**
*   **Description:** Generating synthetic data that accurately reflects real-world ad performance variability and interdependencies (e.g., clicks vs. impressions, conversion rates across campaigns, seasonal trends) can be challenging.
*   **Impact:** Medium (Dashboard insights might be less compelling, some calculations could be artificial).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Research typical ad performance benchmarks. Use libraries or scripts designed for data simulation that allow incorporating some level of trend, variability, and correlation. Clearly document the simulation methodology.

**Risk 2: Complexity of ETL transformations.**
*   **Description:** Implementing complex data cleaning and transformation logic, especially for metrics like retention or derived web metrics, might be time-consuming or require advanced SQL/Python skills.
*   **Impact:** Medium (Delays project completion, potential for data errors).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Break down transformations into smaller, manageable steps. Use standard data manipulation libraries (pandas) and focus on clear, testable code. Start with simpler transformations and add complexity iteratively.

**Risk 3: Achieving the "Apple-style" aesthetic in Tableau.**
*   **Description:** Tableau's built-in design options might limit the ability to perfectly replicate a specific design language like Apple's minimalist style.
*   **Impact:** Low (Dashboard might not look *exactly* like an Apple product, but can still be clean and functional).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Focus on the *principles* of Apple design (cleanliness, typography, whitespace, limited color) rather than pixel-perfect replication. Use custom fonts (if possible and allowed by Tableau Public), careful layout, and consistent formatting. Get feedback on the design iteration.

**Risk 4: Performance issues with the dashboard or ETL.**
*   **Description:** As simulated data volume grows, the ETL process might become slow, or the Tableau dashboard might become unresponsive.
*   **Impact:** Medium (Degrades user experience, makes analysis difficult).
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depending on simulated data volume).
*   **Mitigation:** Optimize SQL queries and Tableau workbook performance. Use data extracts in Tableau Public. Aggregate data at appropriate levels if detailed row-level data isn't needed for all visualizations. Test performance with increasing data volumes during development.

**Risk 5: Deployment challenges.**
*   **Description:** Issues with publishing to Tableau Public (data source compatibility, size limits) or making ETL scripts easily runnable for others (database setup, environment configuration).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Deliverables might not be fully accessible).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Mitigation:** Verify Tableau Public compatibility early. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions in the README for setting up prerequisites and running scripts. Consider containerization (like Docker) if feasible and necessary for easier replication, although this adds complexity.
