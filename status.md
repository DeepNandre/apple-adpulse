## 1. Project Summary

[Provide a brief overview of the project goals, objectives, and the planned timeline. This section should quickly orient the reader to what the project is and its overall status.]

**Example:** This project aims to build an interactive ad performance dashboard using web analytics, SQL, Python, and Tableau, mimicking an Apple aesthetic. The dashboard will integrate simulated/anonymized ad delivery and web analytics data for EMEA campaigns, providing actionable insights on campaign and customer behavior. Key deliverables include a public GitHub repository with reproducible code and a deployed version (Tableau Public + hosted ETL scripts).

**Overall Project Timeline:** [e.g., Start Date - End Date, or Phase breakdown]
*   Phase 1 (Data & ETL Setup): [Dates]
*   Phase 2 (Visualization & Insights): [Dates]
*   Phase 3 (Deployment & Documentation): [Dates]

## 4. Risks and Issues

[Identify current blockers, potential risks to project completion or quality, and the planned mitigation strategies for each.]

*   **Issue:** [Description of the current problem/blocker]
    *   **Impact:** [What is the effect on the project?]
    *   **Mitigation/Plan:** [What steps are being taken to resolve it?]
    *   **Owner:** [Who is responsible?]
    *   **Due Date:** [When is resolution expected?]

*   **Risk:** [Description of the potential risk]
    *   **Likelihood:** [High/Medium/Low]
    *   **Impact:** [High/Medium/Low]
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** [What actions are being taken to reduce likelihood or impact?]
    *   **Owner:** [Who is responsible?]

**Example Issue:**
*   **Issue:** Difficulty replicating exact Apple font/typography in Tableau Public due to licensing/availability.
    *   **Impact:** May compromise the desired 'Apple-style' aesthetic.
    *   **Mitigation/Plan:** Explore suitable alternative web-safe fonts available in Tableau that closely match the aesthetic (e.g., Inter, San Francisco alternatives). Prioritize layout and color scheme consistency instead of exact font match.
    *   **Owner:** [Your Name]
    *   **Due Date:** [Date]

**Example Risk:**
*   **Risk:** Potential performance issues with the Tableau dashboard if simulating a very large dataset.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Mitigation Plan:** Start with a moderately sized dataset. Implement data aggregation/roll-ups in the ETL layer for faster querying in Tableau. Test performance iteratively as data volume increases. Document data volume limitations if necessary.
