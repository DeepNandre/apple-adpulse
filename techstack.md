# Technology Stack Recommendation: Interactive Apple-Style Ad Performance Dashboard

**Version: 1.0**
**Date: June 20, 2025**

---

## 1. Technology Summary

This project requires a technology stack centered around data ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization. The core flow will involve simulating/ingesting raw ad performance data, processing it through an ETL pipeline using Python and SQL, storing it in a relational database optimized for analytics, and visualizing the results in Tableau with a clean, "Apple-style" aesthetic. The architecture emphasizes practicality, reproducibility, and integration of key web analytics concepts.

**Core Components:**
*   **Data Simulation/Source:** Python script or CSV files.
*   **ETL:** Python with data manipulation libraries and database connectors. SQL for cleaning/transformations within the database.
*   **Data Warehouse:** PostgreSQL.
*   **Visualization:** Tableau Public.

## 2. Frontend Recommendations

Given the project's focus on using Tableau for visualization, a custom web frontend framework is not required. Tableau serves as the primary interactive layer.

*   **Primary Visualization Tool:** **Tableau Public**
    *   **Justification:** Explicitly requested and capable of creating interactive dashboards. Supports data source connections, calculated fields for deriving metrics (including Adobe Analytics-style ones), and visualization design. While Tableau Public has limitations (data privacy), it meets the "deployed version" requirement for a public demo. Its styling options allow for achieving a clean, minimalist "Apple-style" look (simple layouts, clear fonts, deliberate use of white space, restrained color palettes).

## 3. Backend Recommendations

The "backend" primarily consists of the ETL pipeline responsible for data processing and loading.

*   **Language:** **Python**
    *   **Justification:** Excellent ecosystem for data manipulation (`pandas`), database interaction (`psycopg2`), and scripting. Widely used in data engineering and analytics, making the code maintainable and reproducible. It's also explicitly requested.
*   **ETL Framework/Approach:** **Scripted ETL using Python libraries**
    *   **Justification:** For a project of this scope, a full ETL framework (like Apache Airflow, Talend, etc.) is likely overkill and adds unnecessary complexity. A well-structured Python script using libraries like `pandas` for data cleaning/transformation and `psycopg2` (or SQLAlchemy) for database interaction is sufficient, maintainable, and easy to set up for a reproducible demo. The script can be modularized into functions for ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and loading.
*   **Data Simulation:** **Python script**
    *   **Justification:** Generating synthetic data within the ETL script using libraries like `numpy` and `pandas` allows for simulating various scenarios (impressions, clicks, conversions, AOV, retention, A/B tests, geo distribution) and ensures the data structure aligns perfectly with the downstream ETL and database schema. Alternatively, static CSVs generated once can be used for simplicity.
*   **API Design:** Not applicable for the ETL process itself unless a mechanism to trigger the ETL via an API is desired (which is not specified as a core requirement). The ETL script will likely be executed via a scheduler (cron job) or manually.

## 4. Database Selection

A robust relational database is needed to serve as the data warehouse for analytics.

*   **Database Type:** **PostgreSQL**
    *   **Justification:** A mature, open-source, and feature-rich relational database. It handles structured data well, is widely supported, and has good performance for analytical queries, especially when indexed appropriately. It's easy to set up locally for development and can be hosted cost-effectively on various cloud providers. It's a standard choice for data warehousing workloads at small to medium scales. Using a "local Snowflake mock" is less practical for a publicly reproducible project compared to a standard RDBMS like PostgreSQL.
*   **Schema Approach:** **Simple Star Schema**
    *   **Justification:** The Star Schema is a standard and effective model for analytical databases. It separates facts (measurable events like impressions, clicks, conversions, spend, derived metrics) from dimensions (attributes like date, campaign, creative, geography, customer segment). This structure simplifies queries for reporting and analytical tools like Tableau and improves query performance compared to highly normalized schemas for analytical use cases.
    *   **Proposed Tables:**
        *   `fact_ad_performance`: Granular data per date, campaign, geo, etc. (Impressions, Clicks, Spend, Conversions, Revenue, AOV, simulated web metrics like sessions, bounce rate, session duration).
        *   `dim_date`: Date attributes (Year, Month, Day, Day of Week, Week of Year, etc.).
        *   `dim_campaign`: Campaign attributes (Campaign Name, Type, Objective, Status).
        *   `dim_geo`: Geographic attributes (Country, Region/State, City, EMEA flag).
        *   `dim_customer` (for lifecycle/cohorts - anonymized): Customer identifier (hashed/simulated), first purchase date, etc.

## 5. DevOps Considerations

Making the project reproducible and deployable requires attention to code management and execution.

*   **Code Repository:** **GitHub** (Public)
    *   **Justification:** Meets the "public GitHub repo" deliverable. Provides version control, collaboration features, and a standard platform for sharing code.
*   **Dependency Management:** **`requirements.txt`**
    *   **Justification:** Standard Python practice to list all necessary libraries (`pandas`, `psycopg2`, etc.) allowing anyone to recreate the Python environment.
*   **ETL Script Deployment:** **Manual Execution or Simple Scheduler**
    *   **Justification:** For a public demo, the Python ETL script can be documented for manual execution. For a slightly more "deployed" feel, it could be set up as a scheduled task (like a cron job on a small virtual machine or a simple cloud function if using cloud DB) that runs periodically to simulate data updates and process them. Avoid complex orchestration tools for simplicity.
*   **Database Hosting:** **Local PostgreSQL or Cloud-Managed PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)**
    *   **Justification:** Local is easiest for development and demonstrating reproducibility from the repo. Cloud-managed provides more reliability and accessibility for a continuously running demo, though potentially incurs cost. Document setup clearly for either approach.
*   **Reproducibility:** Clear documentation in the GitHub repo explaining setup steps, data simulation parameters, database schema creation (`schema.sql`), and how to run the ETL script.

## 6. External Services

Tools and platforms used outside the core self-hosted components.

*   **Visualization Hosting:** **Tableau Public**
    *   **Justification:** Required deliverable for a publicly deployed dashboard.
*   **Version Control & Hosting:** **GitHub**
    *   **Justification:** Required deliverable for code sharing and collaboration.
*   **Cloud Provider (Optional):** **AWS, Google Cloud Platform, DigitalOcean, etc.**
    *   **Justification:** Could be used to host the PostgreSQL database and run the ETL script if not opting for a purely local setup for the demo. Provides managed database services (RDS, Cloud SQL) and virtual machines (EC2, GCE, Droplets).
*   **Data Simulation Libraries:** **Faker** (Optional)
    *   **Justification:** While manual simulation is possible, libraries like `Faker` can help generate realistic-looking fake data (names, addresses, etc.) if needed for dimensions like a simulated `dim_customer` table, adding richness to the dataset beyond just numbers.
